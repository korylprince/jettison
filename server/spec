A SERVER has a specified filesystem directory named a PODBAY
When a SERVER STARTS, it reads the PODBAY directory from the
    ENVIRONMENT VARIABLE JETTISON_PODBAY
In a SERVER's PODBAY there are directories named ROOMs
There is possibly one special ROOM named "all"
Each ROOM can contain arbitrary numbers of FILEs,
    either in the root ROOM directory, or in an arbitrary number
    of sub-directories of ROOM
When a SERVER STARTS, it creates a CACHE of all FILEs in the PODBAY;
    The CACHE will contain the name and CRC32 HASH of each FILE

A SERVER has an HTTP API exposed over a specified LISTEN ADDRESS
When a SERVER STARTS, it reads the LISTEN ADDRESS from the
    ENVIRONMENT VARIABLE JETTISON_LISTENADDR

A SERVER has a LIST API with a ROOM PARAMETER exposed at
    http://<LISTEN ADDRESS>/api/v1/list/<ROOM PARAMETER>
An HTTP GET REQUEST to a LIST API will respond with a JSON RESPONSE
    of all FILEs in the ROOM specified by the ROOM PARAMETER
    as well as the special "all" ROOM
The JSON RESPONSE of a LIST API will be a JSON dictionary with key:
        "<room>/(<possible path of sub-directories>/)/<FILE name>"
    and value: the CRC32 HASH of the FILEs contents.
The JSON RESPONSE will fetch its data from the CACHE
If the contents of a ROOM is changed in any way, the SERVER must
    be RESTARTED for the LIST API and CACHE to reflect the change

A SERVER has a FILE API with a FILE PARAMETER exposed at 
    http://<LISTEN ADDRESS>/api/v1/file/<FILE PARAMETER>
An HTTP GET REQUEST to a FILE API will respond with the contents of
    the FILE on the SERVER located at <PODBAY>/<FILE PARAMETER>
